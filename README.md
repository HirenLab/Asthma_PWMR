Abstract
Background: Asthma, characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, is posing a serious public health issue. This study aims to integrate plasma protein-centric multi-omics data to uncover potential therapeutic targets for asthma.
Methods: We performed a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) derived from multiple protein cohorts, including deCODE genetics, the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project, and the Fenland study. For positive results, we conducted various sensitivity analyses, such as reverse MR and replications with different selections of instrumental variables. Following this, all validated proteins were subjected to replication using additional exposure and outcome datasets, as well as subsequent meta-analyses. Additionally, to confirm the robustness of significant findings, we employed colocalization and summary-data-based mendelian randomization (SMR, utilizing pQTLs from deCODE and eQTLs from eQTLGen). To further validate the roles of the selected causal proteins, we performed enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, phenome-wide MR (PheWAS) and druggability analysis.
Results: The discovery phase identified 33 proteins significantly associated with asthma, with 15 promoting disease onset and 18 offering protective effects. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these associations, and replication studies validated 31 proteins. Integration with colocalization and SMR findings classified six proteins (NMT1, ERK1, MAX, TRYB1, PTK7, IP3KA) as Tier 1. Functional analysis showed significant enrichment in immune response pathways, and PheWAS revealed additional links for NMT1 with hypertension. Druggability assessment identified 8 proteins as potential therapeutic targets.
Conclusion: Our multi-omics approach successfully identified novel therapeutic targets for asthma, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of the disease.
